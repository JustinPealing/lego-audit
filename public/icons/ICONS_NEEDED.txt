PWA Icons Needed
=================

For the app to function as a proper PWA, you need to add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - Used for smaller displays and shortcuts

2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
   - Used for larger displays and splash screens
   - Should be suitable for maskable use (safe zone in center)

Design Suggestions:
- Use a simple LEGO brick icon with the app name
- Colors: LEGO red (#d01012) as primary
- Ensure good visibility on various backgrounds
- Leave padding around edges for maskable icon support

You can use tools like:
- Figma or Canva for design
- RealFaviconGenerator.net for generating different sizes

Note: Until these icons are added, the PWA installation feature will not work properly.
